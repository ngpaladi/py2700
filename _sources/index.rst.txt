=====================================================
The py2700 Digital Multimeter Interface
=====================================================
An unofficial Python package to interface with a Keithley 2700 digital multimeter.



Introduction
----------------

The py2700 package is designed to allow for easy access to common SCPI commands sent to the multimeter. From setting up channels, to reading data, to even writing to the display, the package allows the user to quickly and easily produce working, readable Python code to collect data from their device, and ultimately avoid being forced to pay for a license for Keithley Kickstart.

To install the latest version please run `pip install py2700`

Example Program
------------------
.. code-block::
    :linenos:

    import py2700 as DMM
    import time

    # Connect to a Keithley 2701 over TCP/IP
    my_multimeter = DMM.Multimeter('TCPIP::192.168.69.102::1394::SOCKET')

    # Set the default temperature units
    my_multimeter.set_temperature_units('C')

    # Set the timeout in ms
    my_multimeter.set_timeout(5000)

    # Set Channels 101, 102, and 103 as K-type thermocouples
    my_multimeter.define_channels([101,102,103],
        DMM.MeasurementType.thermocouple('K'))

    # Setup for reading: 
    #   This needs to be completed after channel
    #   definitions and before scanning
    my_multimeter.setup_scan()

    # Scan the channels, given the timestamp you want 
    # for the reading
    result = my_multimeter.scan(time.time_ns()/(10**9))

    # Print out a CSV header for the result
    print(my_multimeter.make_csv_header())

    # Print out a CSV row for the result
    print(result.make_csv_row())

    # Safely disconnect from the multimeter
    my_multimeter.disconnect()
